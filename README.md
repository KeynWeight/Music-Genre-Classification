# Music-Genre-Classification

This is a repository of a streamlit web app. The web app is to classify the song genre of the song using machine learning


## Background
This web app uses XGBoost to build the classification model. This `music-genre-classification-30-secs-81-accuracy.ipynb` notebook shows the building of the model. This notebook is a copy of the work I did on Kaggle. 

This model is trained on GZTAN Dataset, which 1000 songs of 10 genres are trained in the model. On average 81% testing accuracy is attained.




## Installation
